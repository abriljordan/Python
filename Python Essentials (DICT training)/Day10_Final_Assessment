Hint:
a.     You can use any of the following: List, Tuple, Dictionary
b.     len() function is useful in getting the number of elements in your list, tuple or dictionary.
       Example: x = len(Reservation) , where Reservation could be a list, tuple or a dictionary
c.     split() function can divided your string according to the set delimiter.
       Example: s = “A,B,C”
                        x = s.split(“,”) , x will become a list that contains [“A”,”B”,”C”]
